# SudokoSolver
This is a program that solves sudokus. It creates a blank 9x9 sudoku square, and gets the user to fill in the sudoku they want
solved. Then, after presing solve, it will solve the sudoku and display it to the user.

# Why
This was an exercise for me to learn to use Eclipse Integrated with EGit, as well as working with Java Gui creation, as it was 
something I have little experience with. It is also an example of recursion, and logic needed to solve a sudoku efficiently.
